emptydir is a small utility that opens directories, tries to find
directory entries in them, and prints to standard output whether they
are empty or not. emptydir thinks a directory is empty if it has no
directory entries, or if the only directory entries in the directory
are '.', '..' or both.

emptydir is free software under the terms of the GPL (see COPYING).
